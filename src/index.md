# Django Paddle Subscriptions

## Why do you need it?

For SaaS (Software as a Service) businesses expanding into global markets, partnering with a reseller like [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/) can be a strategic move to navigate complex tax regulations and streamline operations. Resellers like Paddle act as intermediaries, handling payments, tax compliance, currency conversions, and localized pricing for their partners, freeing up SaaS companies to focus on their core product offerings.

The rules for VAT (Value Added Tax) and sales tax are varied from country to country.

For example, in the EU, VAT is charged based on the customer's location, regardless of the SaaS provider's headquarters. This means that SaaS businesses outside the EU may need to register for VAT to collect and remit taxes. Paddle simplifies this process by registering for VAT on behalf of its partners and automatically collecting the appropriate tax from each customer.

Similarly, in the US, sales tax regulations vary from state to state. Resellers like Paddle typically handle sales tax compliance, ensuring that SaaS businesses only collect taxes in the jurisdictions where they are legally required. This can save businesses time and money, as they don't need to maintain their tax expertise or register for sales tax in multiple states.

Also, buying power varies greatly between different countries around the world. In wealthier countries like the United States and Western Europe, people generally have more money to spend due to higher incomes and stronger currencies. However, in less developed countries across Africa, Asia, and parts of Latin America, buying power tends to be lower because people earn less money and the cost of living is often higher relative to their incomes.

Django Paddle Subscriptions is a Django app for SaaS projects implementing free and paid subscriptions using [Paddle Billing API](https://developer.paddle.com/). It saves you at least a month of work on implementation. And it is pretty flexible and configurable to meet your business needs.

## Who is it for?

The Django Paddle Subscriptions app is for business owners and tech entrepreneurs who want to provide Django-based SaaS globally.

- MIT license applied.
- Designed and implemented by the author of "Web development with Django Cookbook."

## How does it work?

You will need a seller's account at Paddle and your business and SaaS domains approved (which might take from a few days to two weeks). At first, implement the payments in the [sandbox environment](https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/).

At Paddle, create Products for each subscription plan and one monthly and one yearly price for each plan. For example, Premium plan as a product will have two prices: Premium monthly and Premium yearly.

At your Django website, fetch all data from Paddle, create subscription plans, and attach the prices to the subscription plans accordingly.

Check these workflows:

- Pricing ➔ Subscription ➔ Signup ➔ Billing history
- Signup ➔ Pricing ➔ Subscription ➔ Billing history
- Pausing subscription ➔ Resuming subscription ➔ Cancelling subscription
- Pausing subscription ➔ Cancelling subscription

When ready to go live, create the same products and prices at the [live environment](https://vendors.paddle.com/). Flush the Paddle data on your server, fetch the data from the live server, and connect the prices to your subscription plans. Create a 100% discount code and test subscriptions with that code on the live environment.

## Examples

Django Paddle Subscriptions are used in production at these websites:

- [1st things 1st](https://www.1st-things-1st.com)
